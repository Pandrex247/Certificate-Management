DESCRIPTION
       The renew-self-signed-certificates subcommand renews a self-
       signed certificate using the old distinguished name and alias.
       This certificate is then placed in the key and trust store of
       the target instance or listener replacing the old one.

           is as-install/domains.

       --node
           The unique name of the node where the target instance is located.
           This operand is optional, defaulting to localhost-$domainname
           if not provided.

       --nodedir
           The node root directory, which contains the target node.
           If specified, the path must be accessible in the

       --target
           The name of the instance to add the generated certificate to the
           key and trust store of. Defaults to server (the DAS).

       --listener
           The name of the HTTP or IIOP listener to add the generated
           certificate to the key and trust store of. Only applicable if
